- 👋 Hi, I’m João. Thats portuguese for Juan, John, Jean, Johann, etc. It sounds something like "Shoe-Huang". I live in Florianopolis, South Brazil.
- 👀 I’m interested physics, mathematics, programming and so on. I love simulation, emergent structures and also beautiful and intuitive visualization of complex things, like field theory and critical phenomena.
- 🌱 I’m currently taking on a doctorate in mathematical physics, and have 15 years experience as a programmer in many languages. My favorite by far is C++, which to me works amazingly and is amazingly complemented by Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tools I use and where my skills might be useful and needed.
- 📫 How to reach me: jstreibel@gmail.com
